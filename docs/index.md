We are excited to announce the latest installment of echoIA, **CAROLINA: Connecting Analyses and Research On Lensing and INtrinsic Alignments** at Duke University. The core meeting will take place from Monday, September 15th to Friday, September 19th, 2025. Activites on Friday will draw upon work completed over the course of the week, including final presentations, follow-up planning, and tag-ups.

# About

Characterizing **I**ntrinsic **A**lignment (IA) is necessary for upcoming cosmological surveys to meet science requirements, and IA itself is best constrained through synergies across surveys, particularly between imaging and spectroscopic data. CAROLINA will convene members of cosmological surveys and theory/simulation groups working on the IA of galaxies. The workshop will include short talks by ECS, technical sessions, and overview talks. These "overview" talks are intended to be both a general introduction to aspects of IA and to stimulate discussion around recent advancements. Contact an organizer if you have a topic request or would like to give one of these overview talks. Most of the meeting time will be reserved for hands-on work and discussions, prioritizing cross-collaboration project incubation. Virtual options will be available for all talks and select work sessions. 

This workshop is supported by [echo-IA](https://github.com/echo-IA), a community effort to bring together measurement and modeling experts to coordinate the analysis of future measurements within a common framework.

**[Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTJhZRyLE55l-sz3Nv3eBi1b0ss4TErGtTSa5qn8mC5IQMhQ/closedform) is now closed.**

This workshop is intended to be a collaborative and productive event. We invite participants to propose topics for focused discussion and work sessions (sprints), as well as areas for ongoing collaboration within echoIA in the registration form or by clicking this button:
