We are excited to announce the latest installment of echoIA, **LILAC: Linking Intrinsic Alignments Across Collaborations** at the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA). The core meeting will take place from Monday, May 6th to Thursday, May 9th, 2024. On Friday, May 10, we will have a work/hack day to make progress on implementing models, simulation tools, and data sets. Activites on Friday will leverage discussion from earlier in the week and are ideal for sharing insights and experience relevant for multiple collaborations.

# About

Characterizing IA is necessary for upcoming cosmological surveys to meet science requirements, and IA itself is best constrained through synergies across surveys, particularly between imaging and spectroscopic data. LILAC will convene members of cosmological surveys and theory/simulation groups working on the Intrinsic Alignment (IA) of galaxies. The workshop will include short talks by ECS, technical sessions, and overview talks. These "overview" talks are intended to be both a general introduction to aspects of IA and to stimulate discussion around recent advancements. Contact an organizer if you have a topic request or would like to give one of these overview talks. Most of the meeting time will be reserved for hands-on work and discussions, prioritizing cross-collaboration project incubation. Virtual options will be available for all talks and select work sessions. 

This workshop is supported by [echo-IA](https://github.com/echo-IA), a community effort to bring together measurement and modeling experts to coordinate the analysis of future measurements within a common framework.

**Registration is closed, but participants can update their responses via [the registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgZdo5XGxEM3eLtiTYsqz63FvRK2678SgC50ngcrzq3n4yqA/viewform?usp=sf_link).**

This workshop is intended to be a collaborative and productive event. We invite participants to propose topics for focused discussion and work sessions (sprints), as well as areas for ongoing collaboration within echoIA in the registration form or by clicking this button:
